# README: Airline Customer Satisfaction Prediction System  

## **Project Overview**  
Airline companies thrive on customer satisfaction, which directly influences their revenue and operational success. Poor customer experiences lead to lost customers, reduced flights, and diminished income. This project focuses on predicting customer satisfaction levels based on feedback data collected after flights.  

The dataset includes records of passenger feedback, such as service quality, in-flight comfort, staff friendliness, and more. This project aims to build a machine learning model that predicts customer satisfaction, enabling the airline to diagnose service gaps, address problems proactively, and retain customers by improving their flying experience.  

The resulting system will be integrated into the airline’s operations, where customers submit feedback after each flight. The model will process the responses and deliver predictions to help the airline optimize its services and retain happy customers.

## **Problem Statement**  
Customer dissatisfaction costs airlines revenue and limits their ability to scale operations effectively. This project addresses the issue by creating a predictive model that estimates customer satisfaction based on feedback. The solution will:  

- Identify key factors contributing to satisfaction or dissatisfaction.  
- Provide actionable insights to improve customer experience.  
- Help the airline increase customer retention and generate more revenue.  

The model is designed for real-time deployment using FastAPI, where the predictions are available immediately after passengers submit their feedback.

## **Lifecycle of Model Creation**  

1. **Understanding the Problem Statement**  
   Define the project scope and requirements to accurately predict satisfaction levels.  

2. **Data Collection**  
   Download feedback data, including service quality, in-flight amenities, and overall customer experience.  

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   Analyze the dataset to uncover patterns and identify key satisfaction drivers.  

4. **Data Pre-Processing and Feature Engineering**  
   Handle missing values, engineer relevant features, and prepare data for modeling.  

5. **Model Training**  
   Train tree-based models (e.g., Random Forest, XGBoost) for accurate predictions.  

6. **Model Hyperparameter Tuning**  
   Optimize the model to enhance performance.  

7. **Model Evaluation**  
   Evaluate the model using metrics such as accuracy, F1-score, and precision.  

8. **Model Registry**  
   Save the final model for deployment.  

9. **Model Deployment**  
   Containerize the model using Docker and make it accessible via an API.  

10. **Model Serving**  
    Expose the model through a FastAPI application for real-time feedback prediction.  

11. **Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)**  
    Automate pipeline workflows to ensure reproducibility and scalability.

## **How to Run the System**  

### **Prepare the Dataset**  

1. Download the data from [airline_data_link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/teejmahal20/airline-passenger-satisfaction?resource=download).  
2. Create a folder named `data` in the project root and a subfolder named `raw`. Paste the dataset into the `raw` folder.  
3. Create a `.env` file in the root folder with the following:  

   ```plaintext  
    RAW_PATH_FILE="data/raw/train.csv"
    PROCESSED_PATH_FILE="data/processed/"
    FEATURE_ENGINEERED_DATA_PATH="data/features/"
    MODEL_ARTIFACT_PATH="models/"
    MODEL_OUTPUT_PATH="models/"
    MODEL_PIPELINE_PATH="models/best_model/" 
   ```  

### **Set Up Environment**  

1. Ensure Python 3.10 is installed (recommended using `pyenv`).  
2. Create a virtual environment:  
   ```bash  
   python -m venv venv  
   source venv/bin/activate  
   ```  
3. Install dependencies:  
   ```bash  
   pip install -r requirements.txt  
   ```  

### **Run Pipelines**  

1. Navigate to the `src` folder and execute pipelines:  
   ```bash  
   python run_pipelines.py  
   ```  
2. Logs will display progress. Individual pipelines can also be run from the `src/pipelines` folder.  

### **Deploy the Model Using Docker**  

1. Build the Docker container:  
   ```bash  
   docker build -t capstone-ml-app .  
   ```  
2. Verify the container contents:  
   ```bash  
   docker run -it capstone-ml-app ls -la /app/models  
   ```  
3. Run the container:  
   ```bash  
   docker run -p 8000:8000 capstone-ml-app  
   ```  

### **Test the Endpoint**  

1. Use the provided `request.py` script to send requests to the model endpoint:  
   ```bash  
   python request.py  
   ```

## **CI/CD Integration**  

- The system uses automated CI/CD pipelines to ensure seamless updates to the model and deployment environment.  
- GitHub Actions is configured for:  
  - Running tests on every commit. 
  - Building a docker container. 
  - Ensuring reproducibility with environment checks and dependency management.  
  - Push and publishing updated containers in Dockerhub(cloud) for everyone consumption. 

```plain text
docker pull thobela10/project-app:latest
docker run -p 8000:8000 thobela10/project-app
```
